        <p>
            Single serving charcuterie cups are great for a small family appetizer, 
            watching a movie, or wine out by the fire. 
            A variety of meat, olives, cheese, and berries are arranged on individual extra long toothpicks, 
            and set into cups with trail mix and breadsticks.
